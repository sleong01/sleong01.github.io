<h1>Samantha Leong</h1>

<p>Samantha is a sophomore at Tufts University. She is currently undecided,
but as an avid reader and writer, she is leaning towards an English and
computer science double major. Although, the computer science part will
probably be determined at the end of the semester. In addition to reading,
Samantha also enjoys dancing. She was on the Tufts Ballroom team last year
and recently joined TURBO, an urban breakdance group at Tufts.</p>
